# kickstarter-analysis
##Performing kickstarter-analysis for Louise's project to find hidden trends 

###Louise wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.



#**Category Outcomes**

![Parent](Parent%20Category%20Outcomes.png)

Based on this the chart, it shows that "Theater" is the most popular Topic therefor its the most funded Category and with the most successful rate but with that also the most failed rate. Most people might find Journalism boring therefor was the least funded and all of it did failed

#**Outcomes based on Dates**

![Date](Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

This chart shows that for the Catergory "Theater", May launched the most kickstarters with the most successful rate for all the years 

#**Outcomes based on Goals**

![goals](Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

This chat shows that for the subcatergory "plays" successful percentage rate starts to deline as the pleaged amount started to get higher.

  This dataset is not enough information to make a well informed of conclusion. i think we should make multiple graphs, maybe like a line graph, a bar graphs, or maybe even a pie chart for each of the years in addtions to the overall goals for the all the years combined. Just looking at the graphs on its own i had a hard time seeing the correlation, but after going back and forth comparing the graphs to the overall Kickstarter sheet in the excelsheet I had a better idea of where the numbers came from

#Conclusion

  If Louise wants to start a theater/plays Kickstarter campaigne of her own its probably a good idea to start it around the late spring time to the summer time based on the trends, as the weather is warmer,nicer, and the days are a little longer, people are more incline to leave their house to come watch her play. she should set her goals low as it seems that the higher the pleaged the higher the failure rate as shown in the outcome vs goals chart
